# Avian_tRNAs
Exploring the evolution of tRNAs in bird genomes

This project contains python and R-scripts to analyze the tRNA content of bird genomes

tRNAscan.py - Run tRNAscan-SE on all available bird genomes (combination of three scripts)
tRNA_locations.py - Extract genomic locations of tRNAs from specific text-file
Plot_tRNAs_on_Chromosomes.R - R-script to plot tRNAs on chicken chromosomes (other species have specific scripts)
