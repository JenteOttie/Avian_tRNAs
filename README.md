# Avian_tRNAs
Exploring the evolution of tRNAs in bird genomes

This project contains python and R-scripts to analyze the tRNA content of bird genomes


PYTHON

tRNAscan.py: Run tRNAscan-SE on all available bird genomes (combination of three scripts)

tRNA_Clusters.py: Extract genomic locations of tRNAs from specific text-file and check if they cluster together

R.

Plot_tRNAs_on_Chromosomes.R: R-script to plot tRNAs on chicken chromosomes (other species have specific scripts)
